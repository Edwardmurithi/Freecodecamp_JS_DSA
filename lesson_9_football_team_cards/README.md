# Sports Team Cards Project

## Overview
This project focuses on processing datasets and dynamically displaying information on the screen. By working on this project, I gained hands-on experience with key JavaScript concepts related to **DOM manipulation, object destructuring, event handling, and data filtering**.

## What I Learned
During the development of this project, I explored and reinforced several important programming concepts, including:

### 1. **DOM Manipulation**
   - Dynamically creating and updating elements on the webpage.
   - Efficiently handling user interactions through event listeners.

### 2. **Object Destructuring**
   - Extracting specific properties from objects for cleaner and more readable code.

### 3. **Event Handling**
   - Managing user interactions such as clicks and form inputs to create a dynamic UI.

### 4. **Data Filtering**
   - Using JavaScript methods to process and filter dataset information before displaying it.

### 5. **Default Parameters**
   - Defining functions with default values to handle missing or optional arguments.

### 6. **`Object.freeze()`**
   - Preventing modifications to objects to maintain data integrity.

### 7. **Switch Statement**
   - Revisiting the `switch` statement to handle multiple conditions efficiently.

### 8. **Array `map()` Method**
   - Transforming and modifying data within arrays in an efficient and functional way.

## Conclusion
This project was a great opportunity to strengthen my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals and apply them to real-world scenarios. By leveraging DOM manipulation, event-driven programming, and data processing techniques, I was able to create an interactive and user-friendly application.
